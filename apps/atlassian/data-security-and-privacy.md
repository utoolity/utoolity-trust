# Data Security and Privacy Statement

This data security and privacy statement applies to all Utoolity Apps offered in the Atlassian Marketplace. It outlines the collection and processing of your data by us in general, for Cloud and Server Apps, as well as App specific details, if necessary.

For information specific to our web presence, refer to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy).

## Customer Account Data

Once you license or subscribe to one of our products, Atlassian provides us with your license details, including the name and email address of your registered Atlassian contacts. Utoolity uses this data for accounting, security incident reporting, support, and customer enablement.

We do not have any access to your customer data beyond the information provided by Atlassian over the course of evaluating or purchasing our products.

## Customer Support Data

As an active or potential customer, you may choose to register with our support systems (Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Confluence) in order to submit support requests or access non-public information. We will also register you in those instances if you choose to contact our support team per email. With such registration, we will store your email address, name (if given), and support details in our support systems running in the Atlassian Cloud. Should the support details contain personal data, we recommend anonymizing the data, if possible. If you wish for your personal information to be removed from the Utoolity support systems, please contact our [privacy team](mailto://privacy@utoolity.net).

All data provided to us in the context of a support request will only be used to analyze and solve your requests. Without your explicit consent or a legal basis, your personal data will not be shared with third parties.

## Access to Customer Data

Only authorized Utoolity GmbH employees and subcontractors have access to customer data. Subcontractors are contractually bound to the same data security and privacy standards as our employees.

## Server Apps

Our Server Apps store all data exclusively within your server instances. They do not collect or transmit any data to us, except for the embedded support widgets, which will do so only if you use them to raise a support request - see section Customer Support Data for details.

## Cloud Apps

We do not offer any Cloud Apps in the Atlassian Marketplace at this time. Once this changes, we will update this statement with data collection and processing details specific to those apps.
